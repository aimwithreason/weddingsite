<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staybridge Suites Vancouver-Portland Metro</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We stayed here while we were planning the wedding and had a very pleasant stay. It&rsquo;s a clean hotel with suite rooms and a good balance of amenities and cost. We arranged with the hotel to get our guests a discount here.</span></p>
