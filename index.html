		<h3>Holiday Inn Express</h3>
		<p>We stayed here while on a wedding planning trip and have arranged a small block of rooms for guests to stay at with a discount.

		<h3>Staybridge Suites Vancouver-Portland Metro</h3>
		<p>We stayed here on another planning trip for the wedding and had a very pleasant stay. It&rsquo;s a clean hotel with suite rooms and a good
		balance of amenities and cost. We arranged with the hotel to get our guests a discount here.

		<h2>Transportation</h2>
		<p>As most of our guests will be flying into Portland we would like to help our guests make it to their hotel up in Vancouver, WA. Please let
		us know when you are planning on arriving and we will try to arrange rides for groups of people. If you were planning on renting a car and
		would be willing to help drive a few other guests, please let us know.</p>
