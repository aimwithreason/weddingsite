			<h1>Murphy Mikulski Wedding Information</h1>
		</header>
		
		<nav>
		<h2>Ceremony and Reception will be held at Columbia River Gorge Guesthouse</h2>
		</nav>
		
		<main>
		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<p>Head East on WA Highway 14. Proceed through Camas/ Washougal to the 23 &frac12; mile marker (7 miles east of Washougal). Turn left on Belle
		Center Road. The guest house is located on the right, 1.2 miles after you leave Highway 14.</p>

		<h2>Lodging</h2>
		<p>There are many options for lodging near Washougal. Most options are in Vancouver, WA which is about 25-30 mins from the guesthouse where the
		wedding is being celebrated. Portland is about 40 minutes from the guesthouse.</p>

		<h3>Staybridge Suites Vancouver-Portland Metro</h3>
		<p>We stayed here while we were planning the wedding and had a very pleasant stay. It&rsquo;s a clean hotel with suite rooms and a good
		balance of amenities and cost. We arranged with the hotel to get our guests a discount here.

		<h3>Other lodging</h3>
		<p>Guests are, of course, welcome to stay elsewhere and there are several other hotels near by.
		<br>
		There is a <a href="https://www.ihg.com/holidayinnexpress/hotels/us/en/vancouver/pdxvn/hoteldetail">Holiday Inn Express</a> that is next
		door to the Staybridge and you could walk over to catch the shuttle.</p>

		<h2>Shuttle</h2>
		<p>We will have a shuttle departing to and from Staybridge Suites on September 2nd. Details TBD. We will update this page when we have more
		information</p>

		<h2>Transportation</h2>
		<p>As most of our guests will be flying into Portland we would like to help our guests make it to their hotel up in Vancouver, WA. Please let
		us know when you are planning on arriving and we will try to arrange rides for groups of people. If you were planning on renting a car and
		would be willing to help drive a few other guests, please let us know.</p>
